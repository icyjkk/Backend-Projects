# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in Python. The game allows the user to select a difficulty level, try to guess a random number, and track their best score across multiple rounds.

## Features

- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard levels are available, which determine the number of chances the player has.
- **Random Number Generation**: The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- **Timer**: The game tracks how long it takes for the player to guess the number.
- **Replayable**: After each game, the player can decide whether to play again or quit.
